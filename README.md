# QMUL DSA Study Group

## Overview

As a group, we will be following the [NeetCode 250](https://neetcode.io/practice?tab=neetcode250) problems list since it is a very popular beginner-friendly list for [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). We will aim to solve all of the easy and medium questions from this list (215 in total). Practicing [Data Structures and Algorithms](https://www.w3schools.com/dsa/dsa_intro.php#:~:text=Data%20Structures%20is%20about%20how,through%20and%20manipulating%20data%20structures.) through [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) is good for those who enjoy solving problems or those who wish to land a role in [Big Tech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech).

## Getting Started

-   Create an account on [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io) to track your progress
-   Create an account on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) to attempt the questions
-   Create a copy of this [Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VxwHdupwG4ZFu9HM4IpQ2igPbHfLbVvIpqmFZGE8jVY/edit?usp=sharing) to track your progress and take notes
    -   Alternatively, use a notebook, word doc or notion template
-   Review the following content:
    -   [Python for Coding Interviews](https://youtu.be/0K_eZGS5NsU?si=RUKTszo2kyZEJB6y)
    -   [Top 7 Data Structures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQWr9DFE1ww)
    -   [Big O Notation](https://youtu.be/BgLTDT03QtU?si=etaNR8MMaLCUAmXL)
    -   [Top 7 Algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp3fCihUXEg)
-   Start solving problems from the [NeetCode 250](https://neetcode.io/practice?tab=neetcode250)

## Weekly Plan & Schedule

Our aim to complete all 215 easy and medium problems from the NeetCode 250 list. As a group, we will solve 3 questions per week. However, members are encouraged to solve additional problems in their own time.

This is our group's [learning schedule](/schedule.md).

**Time Commitment:** 3â€“6 hours of practice weekly

**Weekly Routine:**

-   The weekend prior, question sets will be shared in the group chat and updated [here](/schedule.md)
-   The group meets on Wednesdays from 3-5 PM for pair programming and solo coding
-   All updates will be provided via the group chat
