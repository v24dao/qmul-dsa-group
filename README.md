# QMUL DSA Study Group

## Overview

As a group, we will be following the [NeetCode 250](https://neetcode.io/practice?tab=neetcode250) problems list since it a very popular beginner-friendly list for [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). We will aim to solve all of the easy and medium questions from this list (215 in total). Practicing [Data Structures and Algorithms](https://www.w3schools.com/dsa/dsa_intro.php#:~:text=Data%20Structures%20is%20about%20how,through%20and%20manipulating%20data%20structures.) through [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) is good for those who enjoy solving problems or those who wish to land a role in [Big Tech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech).

## Getting Started
- Create an account on [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io) to track your progress
- Create an account on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) to attempt the questions
- Review the following content 
  - [Python for Coding Interviews](https://youtu.be/0K_eZGS5NsU?si=RUKTszo2kyZEJB6y)  
  - [Top 7 Data Structures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQWr9DFE1ww)
  - [Big O Notation](https://youtu.be/BgLTDT03QtU?si=etaNR8MMaLCUAmXL)
  - [Top 7 Algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp3fCihUXEg)
- Start solving problems from the [NeetCode 250](https://neetcode.io/practice?tab=neetcode250)

## Weekly Plan & Schedule

We’ll solve 5 questions per week, aiming to complete all 215 easy and medium problems from the NeetCode 250 list by the end of the academic year. For those starting from zero, this equals roughly 2–300 problems solved!

**Time Commitment:** Expect 3–6 hours of practice weekly

**Weekly Routine:**
- Question sets will be shared in the group chat over the weekend prior.
- We’ll meet most weeks for pair programming or solo coding.
- Updates will be provided via the group chat. 
- Feel free to suggest changes or additional study ideas!

## Approach to solving DSA problems

**Before Attempt:**
- Learn the relevant Data Structures & Algorithms   

**Attempt:**
- Spend 30–40 minutes on each problem before seeking help:
  - Read through the problem carefully
  - Look out for edge cases 
  - Select an approach, remembering to consider the tradeoffs between different approaches
    - It may be helpful to come up with a naive/ brute force approach first, and a more optimal one after 
  - Verbalise and/or write down the time and space complexity of your approach
  - Pseudocode and/or sketch out your approach on a whiteboard/ in a notebook
  - Attempt the problem with a coded soluton (Python is recommended)
  - Debug and optimise your solution when necessary
- If unsuccessful, refer to the following resources, then spend another 20-30 minutes on problem:
  - Hints tab on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
  - The explanation (first) portion of the relevant [NeetCode video](https://www.youtube.com/@NeetCodeIO) 

**After Attempt:**
- Refer to the model solutions on LeetCode/NeetCode and compare it to your own
- Consider discussing the problem with a friend
- Write a short pseudocode explanation of your solution for reference
  - Use a notebook, google sheets, google docs, notion, etc   
- Keep track of the questions you find difficult
  - Re-attempt these after a few days or a week
  - Target these questions during interview prep
