# QMUL DSA Study Group

## Overview

As a group, we will be following the [NeetCode 250](https://neetcode.io/practice?tab=neetcode250) problems list since it a very popular beginner-friendly list for [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). We will aim to solve all of the easy and medium questions from this list (215 in total). Practicing [Data Structures and Algorithms](https://www.w3schools.com/dsa/dsa_intro.php#:~:text=Data%20Structures%20is%20about%20how,through%20and%20manipulating%20data%20structures.) through [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) is good for those who enjoy solving problems or those who wish to land a role in [Big Tech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech).

## Weekly Plan
We will solve 5 questions per week. For those starting from zero, this equates to 2-300 problems solved by the end of the academic year! Expect 3–6 hours of practice weekly. 

## Schedule
- Weekly question sets will be shared in the group chat the weekend prior
- We'll aim to meet on Wednesdays and/or Fridays most weeks
  - Pair programming or solo coding
  - Updates will be provided in the group chat
  - Feel free to make suggestions

## Getting Started
- Create an [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io) to track your progress
- Create an account on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) to attempt the questions
- Review the following content 
  - [Python for Coding Interviews](https://youtu.be/0K_eZGS5NsU?si=RUKTszo2kyZEJB6y)  
  - [Top 7 Data Structures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQWr9DFE1ww)
  - [Big O Notation](https://youtu.be/BgLTDT03QtU?si=etaNR8MMaLCUAmXL)
  - [Top 7 Algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp3fCihUXEg)

## Approach to solving DSA problems
- Everyone has a different way of learning but this is [Vu](https://github.com/v24dao)'s personal approach

### Before Attempt:
- Learn the relevant Data Structures & Algorithms   

### Attempt:
- Spend 30–40 minutes on each problem before seeking help:
  - Read through the problem carefully
  - Look out for edge cases 
  - Select an approach, remembering to the tradeoffs between different approaches
  - Verbalise and/or write down the time and space complexity of your approach
  - Pseudocode and/or sketch out your approach on a whiteboard/ in a notebook
  - Attempt the problem with a coded soluton (Python is recommended)
  - Debug and optimise your solution when necessary
- If unsuccessful, refer to the following resources, then spend another 20-30 minutes on problem:
  - Hints tab on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
  - The explanation (first) portion of the relevant [NeetCode](https://www.youtube.com/@NeetCodeIO) video

### After Attempt:
- Refer to the model solutions on LeetCode/NeetCode and compare it to your own
- Consider discussing the problem with a friend
- Write a short pseudocode explanation of your solution for reference
  - Use a notebook, google sheets, google docs, notion, etc   
- Keep track of the questions you find difficult
  - Re-attempt these after a few days or a week
  - Target these questions during interview prep
