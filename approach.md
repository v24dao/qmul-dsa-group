## Approach to solving DSA problems

Everybody has a differently way of learning. This is [vudaodev](https://github.com/vudaodev)'s personal approach to solving DSA problems.

**Before Attempt:**

-   Learn the relevant Data Structures & Algorithms

**Attempt:**

-   Spend 30â€“40 minutes on each problem before seeking help:
    -   Read through the problem carefully
    -   Look out for edge cases
    -   Select an approach, remembering to consider the tradeoffs between different approaches
        -   It is often helpful to come up with a naive/ brute force approach first
    -   Verbalise and/or write down the time and space complexity of your approach
    -   Pseudocode and/or sketch out your approach
    -   Attempt the problem with a coded solution
        -   Python is recommended
    -   Debug and optimise your solution when necessary
-   If unsuccessful, refer to the following resources before spending another 20-30 minutes on problem:
    -   Hints tab on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
    -   The explanation (first) portion of the relevant [NeetCode video](https://www.youtube.com/@NeetCodeIO)

**After Attempt:**

-   Refer to the model solutions on LeetCode or NeetCode, comparing it to your own
-   Consider discussing the problem with a friend
-   Write a short pseudocode explanation of your solution for reference
    -   Use a notebook, google sheets, google docs, notion, etc
-   Keep track of the questions you find difficult
    -   Re-attempt these after a few days or a week
    -   Target these questions during interview prep
